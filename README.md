# 42-Barcelona
This repository contains coding projects carried out at [42 Barcelona](https://www.42barcelona.com/) (also known as Piscine), from 29/dec/2021 to 23/dec/2021.
## About 42

42 is an initiative that bets on a different learning methodology: without teachers, without classrooms, students learn how to learn and they also do it hand in hand with their peers (peer to peer learning), all with a focus on the world of technology and computer science.
The cursus 42 is totally free for those who are selected by passing a series of tests: two online exams and the "C piscine", a C programming bootcamp of approximately 26 days. The latter is the decisive step to enter cursus 42 as a student.
